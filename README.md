# Show Location Image Plugin

This plugin adds location image display functionality to Request and CI web forms in MSM.
If request or CI has specified location having an attached image, new quick menu button appears automatically.
After clicking on that quick menu button an overlay window with the location image is displayed.
It doesn't matter at what location level image is attached. System will display the closest level location image.
